# Go-full-stack-with-Node-Express-and-MongoDB
This repository contains the code presented in the Go Full-Stack with Node, Express and MongoDB course offered by OpenClassrooms.


This repository contains the backend part only. To obtain the frontend part as well, run the following command inside the project folder
(not inside the backend folder)<br/>
git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/5614116-front-end-app.git frontend

You will also need to install Angular on our machine to run the frontend server, to do this, run the following command inside your frontend folder:
   
   npm install -g @angular/cli

When the installation is finished run the following commands in the terminal:<br/><br/>
cd frontend (if you're not inside the frontend folder)<br/>
npm install (installs all the  required dependencies on your local machine)<br/>
ng serve (starts the Angular Live Development Server)

You're good to go.
